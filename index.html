        <h1>Nicole Alexa the Undergrad Student</h1>
        <h2>4th year in Chemistry with a part time job</h2>
        <p class="bio">Nicole is in her last year of undergrad who appreciates spending time with friends when she is not studying or at work. Her favorite activities are usually spent with her friends whether it be dinner, hikes, or trying new things. Although she is usually calm and fun to be around, keeping up with school, work, and her social life can be stressful.</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make enough money to pay for her groceries each month</li>
                    <li>Pass all her classes so that she can graduate</li>
                    <li>Spend as much time with her college friends as she can before she graduates and leaves her college town</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Frustrations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nicole would prefer a more organized form of splitting the expenses and paying each other back: "Its a messy group chat. Someone says, 'I'll grab the tickets,' then we all Venmo them. But sometimes people take two weeks to Venmo, and I know that person is hurting because of it."</li>
                    <li>She wishes she could set aside some of the money that goes into her bank account somewhere else so that she is less likely to spend it and be out of money when its time to purchase things.</li>
                    <li>She hates it when she has to sit out of group plans when shes tight on money: "Being with my friends is everything. What gets in the way is the 'convenience tax'—like being tired and ordering DoorDash. That $30 could have gone to the trip."</li>
